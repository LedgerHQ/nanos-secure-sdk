# Nano S Secure SDK

This directory contains the SDK for ST31 applications development   

Make sure to use the tagged version matching your development environment as syscalls IDs might have changed

On firmware version 1.6+, 2 SDK branches are temporarily available

* The main branch tracks the updated SDK merging Nano X UI features (Flow) currently only used for a few appilcations (Bitcoin, Ethereum, SSH, U2F)

* The *og-* branches track SDKs compatible with 1.5.5 

Developers are encouraged to migrate their application to the updated SDK to create portable applications between Nano S and Nano X devices

## Are you developing a Nano S application?

If so, you must use this SDK.
